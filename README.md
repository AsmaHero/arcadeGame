# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Features:

* Player can not move off screen
* Vehicles cross the screen
* Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
* Vehicle-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins

## Contributing: 

The game is when you dies 3 times will end. The game will contunue to run if you win to go to next level until you die then it is over.

## Steps to do it: 
* I initialize Character class with 4 properties : x,y,speed,image. and render function to draw the character on canvas
* then these properties are inheritence by Enemy and Player Objects.
* then we identify collisions wjil updating the function. and making the enemies speed normal not to slowly by using random speed.
* then we use the directions in switch using x and y.
*Identify the condition when we pass.
